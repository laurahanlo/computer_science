Using Procedures

<procedure> (<input>,<input>, .....)
				operands
				arguments


def rest_of_string(s):
	return s[1:]

print rest_of_string('audacity')

# Define a procedure, square, that takes one number 
# as its input, and returns the square of that 
# number (result of multiplying
# the number by itself).

def square(n):
    return n*n
print square(5)

Procedure Composition = outputs of first procedure = inputs of second procedure
E.g

def square(n):
	return n * n
x = 37
print square(square(x))
